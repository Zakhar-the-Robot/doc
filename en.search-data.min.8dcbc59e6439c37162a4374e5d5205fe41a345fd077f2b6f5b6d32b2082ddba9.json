Devices can have data located in 0x02\u0026hellip;0xFE registers - 253 bytes Each device mandatorily has registers 0x00 to store command, 0x01 for arguments, and 0x02 to store device state. Commands should be represented by values 0x01\u0026hellip;0xFE Read and write operations are described bellow  Registers #  Minimal register map:\n REG_CMD - Command register. The device is reading commands from here REG_ARG - Optional argument of the command REG_MODE - Mode register. If device support working in several modes, this register should be used to indicate it. other addresses can be used for device specific data  Read/Write operations #  To read master should consequently:\n Send Start state Send Write command Send Register number Send Start state Send Read command Read byte(s) Send NACK Send Stop state  Then read one byte - the value from the register\nTo write data master should consequently:\n Send Start state Send Write command Send Register number Send Data byte(s) Send Stop state  Command writing process #  Full process #   A) Master read the REG_CMD register. If it is not 0x00 - slave should be considered as busy. B) If slave is not busy Master writes 0xFF to REG_CMD C) Optionally write argument to REG_ARG D) Master writes a command to the REG_CMD (command is any value in the range 0x01\u0026hellip;0xFE) E) When the command is executed, slave sets CMD and ARG registers to 0x00  Simplified process #   A) (optionally) Write an argument to REG_ARG B) Write a command to REG_CMD  "},{"id":1,"href":"/doc/docs/communication-protocols/canbus/","title":"Canbus","section":"Communication Protocols","content":"ZakharCAN (ver. 0.0.0) #  The standard is based on the CAN bus protocol.
